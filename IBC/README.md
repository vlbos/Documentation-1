IBC User Guide
-------

### 1. Preface
On the two blockchains between which realized inter-blockchain communication, 
any token conforming to the `eosio.token specification` can register and use the IBC channel for inter-blockchain transfer
, please refer to [Token Registration and Management](Token_Registration_and_Management.md) for more information.
This article describes the IBC user interface and given command line examples.


### 2. "transfer" action 
function definition:
``` 
[[eosio::action]]
void transfer( name from, name to, asset quantity, string memo );
```

*1. "to" account*
The "to" account must be the account which deployed ibc.token contract. In BOS-EOS IBC system, the "to" account on 
both EOS mainnet and BOS mainnet are **bosibc.io**.  
*Note: StartEOS contributed the EOS mainnet account `bosibc.io`; as the encouragement for the community contributions, 
the short-name `io` in BOS mainnet will be delivered to StartEOS.*

*2. "quantity"*
The token must be registered, and the quantity amount must satisfies this token's quotas, see [Token Quotas](#4-token-quotas).

*3. "memo" format*
memo format for ibc transaction is very important, because you should provide acceptance accounts on peer chain in memo string. format is:

**{account_name}@{chain_name} {user-defined string}**

{user-defined string} is optinal  
{chain_name} is defined by "peerchain_name" in ibc.token's "globals" table.  

examples:  
'bosaccount11@bos happy new year 2019'  
'eosaccount11@eos'  


note: if you want to transfer token to "to" account itself, not want a ibc transaction, the memo string must star
with "local", otherwise the transaction will fail. source code refer `token::transfer_notify()` and ` token::transfer()`
in ibc.token contract.


### 3. Command Line Examples
Transfer 100 EOS from EOS mainnet account `eosaccount` to BOS mainnet `bosaccount`
```bash
$cleos -u <eos-mainnet-api> transfer eosaccount bosibc.io "100.0000 EOS" "bosaccount@bos hello!"
```

Withdraw 100 EOS from BOS mainnet account `bosaccount` to EOS mainnet `eosaccount2`
```bash
$cleos -u <bos-mainnet-api> transfer -c bosibc.io bosaccount bosibc.io "100.0000 EOS" "eosaccount2@eos hi!"
``` 

Transfer 100 BOS from BOS mainnet account `bosaccount` to EOS mainnet `eosaccount`
```bash
$cleos -u <bos-mainnet-api> transfer bosaccount bosibc.io "100.0000 BOS" "eosaccount@eos hello!"
```

Withdraw 100 BOS from EOS mainnet account `eosaccount` to BOS mainnet `bosaccount2`
```bash
$cleos -u <eos-mainnet-api> transfer -c bosibc.io eosaccount bosibc.io "100.0000 BOS" "bosaccount2@bos hi!"
``` 

After send transfer action, and waiting for **4 to 5 minutes** (in the case of BPs schedule replacement, it may need up to 8 minutes), 
you can go to the peer chains to check if you have received the token.
It takes so long to wait because that it has to wait for the transaction to enter LIB then start IBC operations,
for more IBC theory please refer to [EOSIO IBC Priciple and Design](EOSIO_IBC_Priciple_and_Design.md).

So users can transfer assets across the chains by using any existing mobile app eosio wallets, 
the existing wallets only need to support the ibc.token contract, because the transfer action interface definition of ibc.token 
contract is exactly the same as that of eosio.token contract


### 4. Token Quotas
All token quotas are defined in ibc.token contracts, take bosibc.io as an example of ibc.token contract, 
please refer to [Token Registration and Management](Token_Registration_and_Management.md) for detailed explanation.
you can get them by following command:
``` 
$cleos -u <eos-mainnet-api> get table bosibc.io bosibc.io accepts
$cleos -u <eos-mainnet-api> get table bosibc.io bosibc.io stats
$cleos -u <bos-mainnet-api> get table bosibc.io bosibc.io accepts
$cleos -u <bos-mainnet-api> get table bosibc.io bosibc.io stats
```

**Example Registered Tokens and Their Quotas**  
The following values are for reference only, possibly inconsistent with settings in ibc.token contracts, 
please query the contract with above commands for real-time quota.
